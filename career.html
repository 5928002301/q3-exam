    Playboi Carti's discography includes three major projects. His self-titled mixtape, *Playboi Carti* (2017), introduced his signature style, characterized by catchy hooks, minimalist production, and his distinctive "baby voice" delivery, with tracks like "Magnolia" becoming viral hits. His debut studio album, *Die Lit* (2018), marked a major step in his career, blending high-energy trap beats with experimental sounds and featuring collaborations with artists like Lil Uzi Vert, Young Thug, and Nicki Minaj. The album was commercially successful, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200. In 2020, Carti released *Whole Lotta Red*, a darker, more aggressive album that pushed the boundaries of his sound, incorporating punk and experimental influences. Though initially met with mixed reviews, the album gained a dedicated following and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, further cementing Carti's place as a trendsetter in modern rap. As of 2024, Carti has announced his new album, I AM MUSIC and already started the rollout months ago, but fans are still waiting for its release.</p>
